# capstone-project-personal-site
This is my only HTML and CSS capstone project.
I've learned a great deal of CSS since the first one and I am almost an intermediate on CSS!!

This website is a personal website like the first one. Soooo it belongs to me and I am the copyright owner!
What I am trying to say this website is basically my personal website soo ALL RIGHTS RESERVED!
See you next time!(With knowledge of javascript I hope)
